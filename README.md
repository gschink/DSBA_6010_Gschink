Bayesian Statistics

Included is a small market portfolio and two meme stock portfolios. The first meme stock portfolio is a user who has a positive view of meme stocks. The second meme stock portfolio is a user who has a negative view of meme stocks. TSLA and TWTR are not technically meme stocks, but they are subject to a binary perception. If you like Elon musk, you will feel good about both TSLA and TWTR. If you can't stand Elon Musk, then you will likely take a negative view of TSLA and his involvement recently in TWTR.
